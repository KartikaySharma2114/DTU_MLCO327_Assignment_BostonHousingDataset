# DTU_MLCO327_Assignment_BostonHousingDataset
This repository contains a project focused on predicting house prices based on various features such as location, size, number of bedrooms, and more, using Linear Regression. The dataset used is the Boston Housing dataset.

Project Details
Objective: Predict house prices based on multiple features to understand and model housing prices in Boston.
Dataset: Boston Housing Dataset
Model: Linear Regression
Libraries Used:
Scikit-learn for implementing Linear Regression
Pandas for data manipulation and analysis
Seaborn for visualization
Matplotlib for plotting
Installation
Clone this repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/house-price-prediction.git
Navigate into the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd house-price-prediction
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Prepare the dataset by downloading it from Kaggle and placing it in the data directory.
Run the Jupyter notebook or Python script to train the model and evaluate its performance:
bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook House_Price_Prediction.ipynb
or
bash
Copy code
python house_price_prediction.py
Results
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): Measures the average error between predicted and actual values.
RÂ² Score: Indicates the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables.
